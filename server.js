        name: "Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI)",
        description: `MBI covers the costs of repairing your car that arise from unexpected mechanical or electrical breakdowns after the manufacturer's warranty expires. It is NOT car insurance; it does not cover accidents, fire, theft, or cosmetic damage.
        Key points for MBI:
        - Covers major components like engine, transmission, fuel system, turbo unit, electrical, cooling systems, and steering.
        - Policies can be expensive ($1,000 to over $4,000 for 1-4 years), often added to car loans (meaning you pay interest on it).
        - Significant exclusions apply: pre-existing conditions, manufacturer recalls, chassis/panel/paintwork/glass, batteries, exhaust systems, catalytic converters, tyres, light bulbs, fuel tanks, keys, cambelt failure, servicing/maintenance, rust/contamination, wrong fuel/oil use, and unapproved repairs. Many "breakdowns" are ineligible.
        - Value varies greatly: potentially invaluable for high-end European cars (due to high repair costs), but less so for highly reliable everyday cars (e.g., Toyota, Honda) where likelihood of frequent or catastrophic failures is lower.
        - Consumer NZ and Australian findings suggest MBI can offer poor value, with a significant portion of the premium going to dealer commissions rather than claims.
        - Not compulsory; you can buy it separately from a car loan.
        - Alternatives include self-insuring (setting aside money for repairs) or getting a pre-purchase inspection and regular servicing.
        - When considering MBI, assess your vehicle's age, mileage, repair history, and intended use. Always read the fine print and compare options carefully.`,

    },
    Comprehensive: {
        name: "Comprehensive Car Insurance",
        description: `Comprehensive car insurance offers the broadest protection. It covers damage to *your own vehicle* (e.g., from accidents, fire, theft, natural disasters) regardless of fault, and also covers damage your vehicle causes to *other people's vehicles or property* (Third Party Liability).
        Key benefits often include: cover for hit-and-run incidents, new vehicle replacement, towing, and rental car options (check specific terms).
        Cost factors: Price varies significantly based on driver's age, gender, accident history, location (e.g., Auckland is 20-35% higher than Dunedin/Hamilton), car model/year, storage location (garage vs street), annual distance driven, and private vs business use.
        Comparison: Our research shows significant price variations, with Cove often being the cheapest and Tower offering very comprehensive policies.
        Important considerations:
        - Always compare quotes and avoid auto-renewing.
        - Consider 'Agreed Value' vs 'Market Value': 'Agreed Value' provides a fixed payout (good for cars holding value), while 'Market Value' pays out based on current market worth (which depreciates). Be aware of depreciation clauses.
        - Paying annually can save 10-15% compared to monthly.
        - Be aware of common exclusions and hidden clauses: depreciation clauses on agreed value, 'betterment charges' (paying for upgraded parts), named driver restrictions, no cover for unsealed roads/private property, unauthorised repairs, and rental car coverage traps.
        - Always disclose accurate information to your insurer to avoid claim denials.
        - You can reduce premiums by increasing excess, paying annually, bundling policies, installing security devices (for high-risk cars like Toyota Aqua, Mazda Demio), and maintaining a no-claims record.`,
        link: "https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/car-insurance.html"
    },
    ThirdParty: {
        name: "Third Party Car Insurance",
        description: `Third Party car insurance is the most basic and often legally required type of car insurance. It *only covers* the cost of damage your vehicle causes to *other people's property* (e.g., their car, fence, or building). It does NOT cover any damage to your own vehicle if you are at fault.
        There are two main types:
        1. **Standard Third Party:** Protects you from legal liability for damage you cause to other people's vehicles and property. It does NOT cover your own car for any damage, theft, or fire.
        2. **Third Party Fire and Theft:** Adds coverage for your own car if it is stolen or damaged/destroyed by fire (unrelated to an accident you caused). It still does NOT cover accidental damage to your own car if you are at fault.
        Key points for Third Party policies:
        - Generally suitable for low-value vehicles (e.g., under $5,000 market value) where you can afford to repair or replace your own car.
        - Some policies (e.g., Tower, AA Insurance, AMP, AMI, State, Protecta) may cover damage to your car if an uninsured third party is at fault and you can identify them (up to a certain limit, typically $3,000-$5,000).
        - Exclusions typically include: accidental damage to your own car if you're at fault, storm/water/hail damage to your car, and items stolen *from* your car (these are usually covered by Comprehensive).
        - Costs typically start around $200 a year (for drivers over 25 with no accident history). Third Party Fire and Theft is more expensive than standard Third Party, but still significantly cheaper than Comprehensive.
        - Cost-saving tips: buy online (often discounts), set driver age restrictions (e.g., 25+), pay annually (10-20% savings), and never auto-renew.
        - Cove Insurance is noted to sometimes offer Comprehensive cover at prices comparable to Third Party Fire and Theft policies, making it a worthwhile comparison for those looking to upgrade.`,
